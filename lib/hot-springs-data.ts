    address: "County Road 291, Nathrop, CO 81236",
    website: "N/A",
    detailedDescription: "Alpine Hot Springs is a rustic and undeveloped hot springs destination located high in the Colorado Rockies near Nathrop. These primitive natural pools offer an authentic mountain hot springs experience surrounded by spectacular alpine scenery. The springs provide a peaceful retreat for visitors seeking solitude and connection with nature in a pristine mountain environment.",
    location: "Located in the mountains near Nathrop, Colorado, in the Arkansas River valley at an elevation of 8,000 feet in the San Isabel National Forest.",
    directions: "From Nathrop, take County Road 291 west into the mountains. The road becomes rough and may require high-clearance vehicle depending on conditions. Follow the road for several miles to reach the hot springs area. GPS coordinates and local guidance are recommended.",
    accessibilityDetails: "Alpine Hot Springs requires moderate outdoor skills and preparation. Access may require high-clearance vehicle and short hiking. The area is seasonal and typically accessible from late spring through early fall. No facilities or marked trails. Weather conditions can affect accessibility.",
    hotSpringDetails: "The hot springs feature small primitive natural pools with temperatures ranging from 98-110°F. The pools are undeveloped and formed naturally by geothermal activity. Pool sizes vary but typically accommodate 2-4 people and are 2-3 feet deep. The mineral-rich water contains sodium and calcium and flows naturally from mountain springs. The alpine setting at 8,000 feet elevation offers stunning mountain views.",
    tips: "This is a clothing optional location. Bring towels and water as there are no facilities. Access is seasonal (typically late spring through early fall) due to mountain weather and road conditions. High-clearance vehicle may be required depending on road conditions. Practice Leave No Trace principles to preserve this pristine alpine environment. Dispersed camping may be available but requires preparation and appropriate permits. Weather can change rapidly in the mountains. Best visited during summer months when roads are more accessible and weather is stable.",
